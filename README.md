This is code page for paper "Learning Multiple Coordinated Agents under Directed Acyclic Graph Constraints" submitted to ICLR 2024.
For confidentiality reasons, we offer only three artificial environments in our repository.

## Task Settings
### Resource Collection

The environments **Collection_v1**, **Collection_v0**, and **Collection_v2** correspond to the S1, S2, and S3 settings in the paper respectively. The multiple bonus levels settings can be run in **Collection_v3** (each agent has 1 skill) and **Collection_v4** (each worker has 3 skills).

### Crafting

**Crafting_v0** and **Crafting_v1** stand for the standard setting and the multiple bonus levels setting respectively in the paper.
